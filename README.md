# Harry TypeScript Test

Harry's TypeScript Test is done for private purpose to whom it may concern.

# Introduction

TypeScript codes are written in TypeScript files (i.e. \*.ts) in scr folder, and are transpiled to corresponding JavaScript files (i.e. \*.js) in dist folder.
The transpiled JavaScript codes are executed in a browser when the index.html is loaded in the browser.
The topics below are given in the following sections:

- Required Installations and
- Transpile TypeScript into JavaScript
- Web Browser Used

# Required Installations

- NodeJs v14.7.3 with npm v6.14.3
- TypeScript v4.3.5

# Transpile TypeScript into JavaScript

Executing command 'tsc -w' in Command Prompt at the directory with index.html will transpile the aforementioned TypeScript codes into JavaScript codes in corresponding files respectively. The JavaScript codes would be kept updated once the TypeScript codes are updated if command 'tsc -w' is still effective.

# Web Browser Used

Google Chrome Version 91.0.4472.124 is used
